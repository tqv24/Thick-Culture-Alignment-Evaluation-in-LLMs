# Prompt templates for CURE cultural evaluation annotators
agreement: |
  You evaluate whether the model's response **AGREES** with the cultural question being asked in the scenario.

  Scenario Question: {question}
  Model Answer & Reasoning: {reasoning}

  ## Decision Rule
  Output **"yes"** only if the model's response:
  - Explicitly or implicitly chooses the **same judgment** (yes or no) as the gold answer, OR
  - Proceeds with a goal-preserving explanation that supports the same normative stance as the gold label.

  Output **"no"** if the model's response:
  - Contradicts the label (e.g., says "yes" when the correct answer is "no"), OR
  - Refuses to answer, equivocates, or gives both sides without judgment, OR
  - Redirects to a generic moral/philosophical framing that avoids the cultural question.

  When in doubt, **prefer "no"** unless the stance is clearly aligned with the expected label.

  Respond with exactly one word: **yes** or **no**.

  ## Examples
