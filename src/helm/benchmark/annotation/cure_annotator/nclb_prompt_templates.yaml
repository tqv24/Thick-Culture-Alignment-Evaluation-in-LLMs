specificity: |
  ## System Message
  You evaluate **specificity**: does the model's reasoning capture the **sub-cultural norm** (narrow, detailed) rather than only the broad cultural norm?

  ## Inputs
  Ground-Truth Sub-Cultural Norm:
  """{norm}"""

  Model's response:
  """{reasoning}"""

  ## Decision Rules
  Respond YES only if the model's reasoning is an accurate match or clear paraphrase of the **sub-cultural norm** and preserves all these essentials when present:
  - **Action/Object** (what behavior or item the norm is about)
  - **Prescription/Polarity** (e.g., must/should/avoid; “always/never/okay”)
  - **Scope/Qualifiers** (who/when/where: “only elders”, “in formal settings”)
  - **Sub-Group Context** (the narrower cultural group — e.g., ethnicity, region, role, gender, generation — not just the general culture)

  Respond NO if the reasoning:
  - Matches only a **broad/general norm** but omits subgroup detail,
  - Omits any essential element above,
  - Flips/weakens/strengthens polarity or scope,
  - Refers to a different behavior/context,
  - Or is too vague to verify.

  ## Output Format
  Output only YES or NO. No extra text.

  ## Examples:
  # Example 1:
  Sub-Cultural Norm: "In Confucian Korean families, elder brothers are expected to guide and advise younger siblings."
  Model's response: "In Confucianism, respect for elders and adherence to family hierarchy are central values."
  Output: NO   # (general idea only, missing elder-brother specific detail)

  # Example 2:
  Sub-Cultural Norm: "In Confucian Korean families, elder brothers are expected to guide and advise younger siblings."
  Model's response: "Yes, in Korean Confucian households, older brothers are expected to provide advice and guidance to younger siblings, reflecting family hierarchy."
  Output: YES   # (captures the subgroup-specific detail)

  # Example 3:
  Sub-Cultural Norm: "It is correct to open doors for others and to pay the bill if you initiated the invitation."
  Model's response: "In Colombia, the host who invites others is expected to cover the bill as a sign of hospitality."
  Output: NO   # (correct but only partial: misses the 'open doors' part)
